## Introduction to Computer Vision - Take Home Exam 2

### FILES
1. the2.pdf: Contains the homework text, the details of the required text can be found here.
2. the2.py: Implements an algorithm to solve the object recognition problem using BoF (Bag of Features), SIFT, and k-NN, whose details are given in the homework text, ie, the2.py.
3. the2_report.pdf: Explains the SIFT, Dense-SIFT feature extractors, and Bag of Features algorithm by explaining the construction of vocabulary for images using feature extractors and k-means algorithm. Further, it discusses the effects of different parameter choices for SIFT, Dense-SIFT, k-NN, and k-means.
4. the2_data.zip: Contains train, validation, and test data. 

### Usage

Cloning the repository, one can run the2.py script, changing the parameters for SIFT and Dense-SIFT, the number of neighbors for k-NN, and the number of clusters for k-means clustering. the2_data.zip contains the train, validation, and test data set, and one can use these directly by unzipping the file. Also, different datasets can be used, whose paths are given in the the2.py script between lines 29-32.
